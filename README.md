# Dark_Matter
This repository includes mathematica codes for reproducing and cross-checking the results from sterile neutrino dark matter pioneered papers. Also it includes codes for freeze out and freeze in processes using toy models.Along with this, there are codes for leptogenesis process using neutrinos in early universe.
The codes associated with topics are as follows:
1. leptogenesis: leptogenesis_1.nb, leptogenesis_new.nb
2. shi-fuller mechanism: Fuler.nb,Shi fuller.nb,Shi-Fuller new.nb,Shi-fuller updated.nb, new shi.nb
3. toy models for freeze out and freeze in process: Toy1.nb,toy 2.nb
